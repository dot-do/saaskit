# The Gap

You have an idea.

Maybe it's been rattling around your head for months. Maybe years. You can see it. You can feel customers using it. You know it would work.

But you haven't built it.

Not because you can't. Because between your idea and a running business stands **everything else**:

Authentication. Authorization. User management. Billing. Subscriptions. Admin dashboards. CRUD interfaces. API design. Documentation. SDK generation. CLI tooling. Webhooks. Rate limiting. Error handling. Landing pages. Legal entities. Business banking. Compliance. Marketing. Sales. Support.

That's not your idea. That's the tax you pay to have an idea.

Six months. Twelve months. Maybe never.

**What if it didn't have to be that way?**

---

# The Shift

What if you could describe your business—just your business—and everything else appeared?

Not a template. Not a boilerplate. Not "some assembly required."

Your actual business. Your nouns. Your verbs. Your logic.

And from that: App. API. Site. Docs. CLI. SDK. Webhooks. Billing. All of it. Running. Live. Yours.

```tsx
<SaaS name="YourIdea">
  {$ => {
    $.nouns({ Customer: { name: 'string', email: 'string' } })
    $.verbs({ Customer: { notify: $ => $.api.emails.send({ to: $.record.email }) } })
  }}
</SaaS>
```

That's not pseudocode. That's a business.

---

# What You Get

From those few lines, everything derives:

| You Write | You Get |
|-----------|---------|
| Nouns | Database schema, CRUD API, Admin UI, Search, Relationships |
| Verbs | API endpoints, CLI commands, Webhook triggers, SDK methods |
| Events | Real-time subscriptions, Workflow triggers, Slack notifications |
| Schedules | Cron jobs, Recurring tasks, Automated reports |
| Agents | AI workers with tools, Human-in-the-loop, Autonomous operations |

**One definition. Infinite derivations.**

---

# The Cascade

Your single `<SaaS />` definition cascades into a complete business:

## App
Full React admin dashboard at `yourapp.saas.dev`. Dashboard, CRUD for every noun, settings, team management, billing portal, API keys, webhooks. Done.

## API
REST + GraphQL + WebSocket at `api.yourapp.saas.dev`. Every noun gets CRUD. Every verb becomes an endpoint. Real-time subscriptions for everything. Done.

## Site
Landing page at `yourapp.io.sb`. Hero section, features derived from your nouns, pricing from your plans, testimonials when you earn them. Done.

## Docs
API reference at `docs.yourapp.io.sb`. Authentication guide, endpoint reference, webhook events, SDK installation. Done.

## CLI
Command-line interface via `npx yourapp`. Every noun, every verb, accessible from terminal. Done.

## MCP
Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor. Your customers can talk to your SaaS. Done.

## SDK
Type-safe client library via `npm install yourapp`. Full TypeScript support, real-time subscriptions, every operation typed. Done.

## Zapier
Your app auto-publishes to Zapier. Triggers for every event, actions for every verb, searches for every noun. Done.

## Stripe
Subscriptions flowing via Stripe Connect. Plans, pricing, trials, upgrades, downgrades, invoices. Done.

# The $ Context

The `$` is your handle to everything. No configuration. No glue code. Just use it.

```typescript
$.db       // Database operations
$.ai       // AI-generated content
$.agents   // AI workers with tools
$.human    // Human-in-the-loop
$.api      // 9000+ integrations
$.send     // Fire-and-forget events
$.do       // Durable workflow steps
$.on       // React to events
$.every    // Scheduled tasks
```

Need to charge a customer? `$.api.stripe`
Need to send an email? `$.api.emails`
Need AI to write something? `$.ai`
Need human approval? `$.human.approve`
Need to notify Slack? `$.api.slack`

It's all there. Ready. Waiting for your business logic.

# AI Native

SaaSkit doesn't bolt on AI. It's built from AI primitives.

## Generate Content
```typescript
const email = await $.ai`Write a welcome email for ${customer.name}`
```

## Deploy Agents
```typescript
$.agent('support', {
  instructions: 'You are a helpful support agent...',
  tools: ['getCustomer', 'refundOrder', 'escalate'],
})
```

## Keep Humans in the Loop
```typescript
if (amount > 500) {
  await $.human.approve(`Approve $${amount} refund?`)
}
```

Your SaaS thinks, acts, and knows when to ask for help.

# Real Example

A complete recruiting SaaS. In one file:

```tsx
<SaaS name="RecruitKit">
  {$ => {
    $.nouns({
      Candidate: {
        name: 'string',
        email: 'string',
        skills: ['~>Skill'],      // Fuzzy match to taxonomy
        matches: ['<-Match'],
      },
      Match: {
        score: 'number',
        status: 'new | shortlisted | contacted | hired',
        candidate: '->Candidate',
      },
    })

    $.verbs({
      Match: {
        contact: async $ => {
          const email = await $.ai`Write recruiting email to ${$.record.candidate.name}`
          await $.api.emails.send({ to: $.record.candidate.email, body: email })
          return $.db.Match.update($.id, { status: 'contacted' })
        },
      },
    })

    $.on.Match.hired(async (match, $) => {
      await $.api.slack.send('#wins', `${match.candidate.name} hired!`)
    })

    $.every.Monday.at9am(async $ => {
      const stats = await $.db.Match.aggregate({ hired: { status: 'hired' } })
      await $.api.slack.send('#metrics', `Weekly: ${stats.hired} hired`)
    })

    $.agent('sourcer', {
      instructions: 'Find candidates that match search criteria.',
      tools: ['searchCandidates', 'scoreMatch'],
    })
  }}
</SaaS>
```

**250 lines of business logic. Complete recruiting platform.**

App, API, landing page, docs, CLI, SDK, webhooks, billing—all derived.

# The Transformation

This isn't about saving time. Though you will.

This isn't about saving money. Though you will.

This is about **becoming**.

You have an idea. You've had it for too long.

Stop being someone who *wants* to build a SaaS.

Start being someone who *runs* a SaaS.

**A profitable one.**

---

# Your Move

The gap between idea and business used to be six months of infrastructure.

Now it's one file and one command.

Your idea. Your nouns. Your verbs.

Everything else is our job.

**Idea → Profitable SaaS.**

**Wantrepreneur → Entrepreneur.**
